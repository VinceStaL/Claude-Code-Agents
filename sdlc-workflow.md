# SDLC Agent Workflow Guide

This document outlines the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) workflow using the specialized agents, their artifact handoffs, collaboration patterns, and human intervention points.

## üéØ Overview

The SDLC workflow follows a structured approach where each agent produces specific artifacts that serve as inputs for subsequent agents. This ensures seamless collaboration and maintains quality throughout the development process.
