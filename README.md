# Claude Agents Collection

This repository contains a collection of specialized AI agents, each designed to provide expert-level assistance in specific domains. Each agent has been carefully crafted with deep domain expertise and follows structured methodologies to deliver professional-quality results.

üìã **[Complete SDLC Workflow Guide](./sdlc-workflow.md)** - Comprehensive guide for using agents in enterprise software development projects with phase-by-phase collaboration, artifact handoffs, and human intervention points.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Each agent is designed to be invoked when specific expertise is needed. The agents work best when:

1. **Context is provided**: Share relevant files, current state, and specific challenges
2. **Clear objectives**: Define what you want to achieve
3. **Constraints are mentioned**: Budget, timeline, technical limitations
4. **Feedback is given**: Iterate based on initial recommendations

### üéØ Flexible Agent Selection

You can choose agents based on your project's complexity and requirements:

#### For Comprehensive Enterprise Projects

Use the **specialized SDLC workflow** with individual agents for maximum control and expertise:

- **Business Analyst** + **Senior Product Manager** for thorough requirements and strategy
- **UX Design Master** + **UI Design Genius** for specialized design expertise
- **Frontend Elite** + **Backend Elite** for dedicated development expertise
- **QA Testing Expert** + **Cybersecurity Expert** for comprehensive quality assurance

See our [SDLC Workflow Guide](./sdlc-workflow.md) for detailed phase-by-phase collaboration.

#### For Smaller or Fast-Track Projects

Use **consolidated agents** for streamlined development:

- **Elite Fullstack Developer** instead of separate Frontend/Backend Elite agents
- **UI/UX Design Expert** instead of separate UX Design Master + UI Design Genius
- **Code Reviewer** + **Debugger** for combined quality assurance

#### Hybrid Approach

Mix and match based on your specific needs:

- Use specialized design agents (UX + UI) with a fullstack developer
- Use specialized development agents (Frontend + Backend) with a consolidated design expert
- Add **QA Testing Expert** and **Cybersecurity Expert** for any project requiring robust quality assurance

## üìù Usage Examples
